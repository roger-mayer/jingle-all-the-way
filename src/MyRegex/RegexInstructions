Write a class called MyRegex which will contain a
string pattern. You need to write a regular
expression and assign it to the pattern such that it
can be used to validate an IP address. Use the
following definition of an IP address:

IP address is a string in the form "A.B.C.D", where
the value of A, B, C, and D may range from 0 to 255.
Leading zeros are allowed. The length of A, B, C, or
D can't be greater than 3.

In this problem you will be provided strings containing any
combination of ASCII characters. You have to write a regular
expression to find the valid IPs.

Just write the MyRegex class which contains a String . The
string should contain the correct regular expression.

(MyRegex class MUST NOT be public)

Because in regex's "." has a special meaning which says match any character.
To match only a dot you need an escape character and make it "."
However, for Java "\" has special meaning. So you have to escape the escape character and that makes it "\."
